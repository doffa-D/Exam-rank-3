# get_next_line

To accomplish this, the function will need to read data from the file descriptor using the read function, which reads a specified number of bytes from a file descriptor and stores them in a buffer. The function should keep reading from the file descriptor until it reaches the end of a line, which is indicated by a newline character ('\n').

The get_next_line function should use dynamic memory allocation to manage the buffer for reading data from the file descriptor. The size of the buffer should be defined by a macro called BUFFER_SIZE, which will be provided at compile time. The get_next_line function should use malloc to allocate memory for the buffer, and free to release it when it is no longer needed.

When the get_next_line function reaches the end of the file, it should return the last line that was read, if any. If there is no data left to read, it should return NULL.

It's important to ensure that the function is free of memory leaks, meaning that all memory that is allocated during the execution of the function is released properly before the function returns.

It's also important to ensure that the function behaves correctly when reading from different types of file descriptors, such as standard input or output, or from a file that has been redirected.

Lastly, it's worth noting that the function may not behave correctly when reading from a binary file, which can contain data that does not conform to the format of a text file.

# ft_printf

The function should be declared with the signature int ft_printf(const char *, ... );, which is similar to the signature of the standard printf function.

The function should use variable-length argument lists, which are provided in C using the stdarg.h header and a set of macros, including va_start, va_arg, va_copy, and va_end. These macros allow a function to access the arguments that were passed to it, even when the number and types of arguments are not known at compile time.

The function should output its results using the write function, which writes data to a file descriptor, typically STDOUT or STDERR.

To implement the behavior of the %s, %d, and %x format specifiers, the function will need to use the va_arg macro to retrieve the next argument from the variable-length argument list, and then format the argument as a string, using the appropriate format specifier.

For example, to handle the %s format specifier, the function would retrieve a char* argument using va_arg, and then output it using the write function.

To ensure that the function is free of memory leaks, the function should use malloc to allocate memory for any strings or other data that it needs to format or output, and free to release this memory when it is no longer needed.

It's important to ensure that the function behaves correctly for a wide range of input values, including edge cases like very large or very small integers, or very long strings.

Lastly, it's worth noting that the function may not behave identically to the standard printf function in all cases, as there are many different options and variations that can affect the output of printf.
